# VBA-Challenge_Week2
The goal of this project was to get us to start thinking in a problem based method.  We started with a sample data set, created code, and solved problemsn with in our data.  We applied the data to a larger sample. In addtion, we applied our newly learned skills to create conditionals and loops within our code.  All of this took place in the language of VBA. 

To complete this project, I started with small pieces of information that I new.  I outlined the problem that I wanted to solve and listed as many variables as I could think of for this particular data set.  From there, I created a loop and worked one problem at a time until I came up with comprehensive code for my smaller data set.  

With more time, I could keep solving and debugging the code I created.  I also needed to apply the code to the larger data set and debug.  It was a challenge and I would love to spend more time with this particular project in the future.
